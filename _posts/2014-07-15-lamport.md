The original [article](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/time-clocks.pdf) defines Lamport clocks as, essentially, a tuple of a number (plain timestamp) and a process id.
Each process stamps its new event with a number, assuming it is greater than any previously known timestamp number.
Concurrent events created by different processes may have equal timestamp numbers.
Such tie is resolved in an arbitrary but consistent way, namely by comparing (unique) process ids.

Swarm employs a variant of Lamport timestamps to identify events. In our past projects we used Lamport timestamps literally defined as a pair of integers. That approach ws not rich enough for the general case, so finally we settled no the following scheme:

![Swarm specifiers (compound event identifiers)]({{ site.url }}/images/spec.png)

The Lamport timestamp is `!8V7N809+Walt~ssn`. Both parts of the timestamp are different from the "literal" scheme.
First, the "number" component is an actual [timestamp in base64](https://github.com/gritzko/swarm/blob/680b52128bb1e87ce3ead9edbe0f5ab480a56b3f/lib/swarm3.js#L1456) (i.e. `8V7N809` is seconds since 1 Jan 2010).
That assumes some level of clock synchronization between replicas.
Practically, web clients with bad clocks must coordinate with their server.
Second, the "process id" is a combination of a user id (like `Walt`) and a session id (like `ssn`).
It is extremely useful feature to see the author of an event straight from the event id.
Session id is needed to differentiate different sessions of the same user (like Chrome on a home PC and Safari on a laptop).
While sessions have same data and same credentials, still they are concurrent processes generating independent events.

I hope, that explains that slightly unfamiliar look of Lamport timestamps in Swarm.
