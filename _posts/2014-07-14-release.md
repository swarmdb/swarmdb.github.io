After a year of work, we finally release the third iteration of the 
[Swarm library on Github](https://github.com/gritzko/swarm).
Swarm is a reactive data sync lib that provides a replicated model for your web app (like M in [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)).
Swarm syncs in real time and also works offline.

This time, it goes beyond timestamped [Last-Write-Wins](http://basho.com/tag/last-write-wins/) objects.
LWW was simple to implement and understand, but it was not nearly good enough for complex concurrent apps, e.g. collaborative editors.
Swarm 0.3 has a "pure op-based" [CRDT](http://kellabyte.com/2013/05/20/convergent-replicated-data-types/) foundation with LWW objects and CT text editing implemented on top of that.
I am still amazed how we fit it all into 2KLoC of JavaScript :)

Swarm is essentially a toolkit to build ditributed real-time offline-ready MVC apps where all the "ditributedness" is nicely encapsulated in a replicated Model.
So, View and Controller may act locally (and think globally, you know).
Please check our little [demo and manifest](http://ppyr.us:8000/example/demo3/index.html).

In the coming weeks, I will post more design/implementation details on this blog.
