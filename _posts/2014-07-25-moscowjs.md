About a week ago I presented Swarm.js at the
[MoscowJS](http://www.moscowjs.ru/) meetup.
The talk generated substantial interest.
Well, I was asked questions till the security asked us all to
leave the building :)
Slides can be seen on Slideshare:

The slides are in Russian, kind of, but two key slides are perfectly
readable in any language.
First, that is the deployments scenario for Swarm.js:

![Swarm: deployment]({{ site.url}}/images/swarm-moscowjs-deployment.png)

That is, basically, Redis meets Pusher: server-side component both
caches objects and relays changes to client-side replicas.
In the most straightforward scenario, the server runs node.js thus
fully duplicating client-side logic.


That brings several advantages.
First and foremost, the logic is implemented just once.
Second, the server may always render static HTML for the client thus a
new client is sent static gzipped HTML (fast), then downloads
JSON and makes the page "live" (slow).
That capability was nicknamed "holy grail" by some.
Third, it streamlines development a lot that code paths are unified for local
and remote operations, also client-to-server and server-to-client event
propagation.


There are disadvantages as well.
At scale, running a full clone of each client on the server
might turn expensive.
So, sometimes it makes more sense to make that "event switching bus" as
dumb as possible, while running JavaScript logic in batch mode.
Also, security freaks may dislike the fact that server-side logic is
available for inspection. Well, security by obscurity is harmful in
the long run, but it works to some degree anyways.

Another slide nicely depicts our dream: developing real-time
offline-ready apps with the ease of classic local MVC apps.

Replicated model is the key!
